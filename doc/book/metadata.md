abstract: General Purpose Input Output for a Multi-Processor System on Chip. A Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is a System on Chip (SoC) which includes multiple Processing Units (PU). As such, it is a Multi-Core System-on-Chip. All PUs are linked to each other by a Network on Chip (NoC). These technologies meet the performance needs of multimedia applications, telecommunication architectures or network security. A General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) is an uncommitted digital signal pin on an Integrated Circuit whose behavior, including whether it acts as input or output, is controllable by the user at run time. The purpose of a GPIO is implemented by the designer of higher assembly level circuitry, the circuit board designer in the case of integrated circuit GPIOs.
